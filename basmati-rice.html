            <li>Place rice into a bowl with enough water to cover.Set aside to soak for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, in the last 10 minutes of soaking, heat oil in a large pot or saucepan over medium 
                heat. Add cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves, then stir in cumin seed. Cook and stir until 
                fragrant and toasted, about a minute, then add onion to the pot. Saute onion until the color is 
                a rich golden brown, about 10 minutes.

            <li>
                Drain water from rice, and stir into the pot. Cook and stir rice until lightly toasted,
                about 3 minutes. Add water and salt, and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low.
            </li>
            <li>
                Simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed. Let stand for 5 minutes,
                then fluff with a fork before serving.
